Description: Compute marginal effects from statistical models and returns the 
    result as tidy data frames. These data frames are ready to use with the 
    'ggplot2'-package. Marginal effects can be calculated for many different 
    models. Interaction terms, splines and polynomial terms are also supported. 
    The two main functions are ggpredict() and ggeffect(). There is a generic 
    plot()-method to plot the results using 'ggplot2'.
