Description: Compute marginal effects at the mean or average marginal effects from 
             statistical models and returns the result as tidy data frames. These 
             data frames are ready to use with the 'ggplot2'-package.
             Marginal effects can be calculated for many different models. Interaction
             terms, splines and polynomial terms are also supported. The two main
             functions are ggpredict() and ggaverage(), however, there are
             some convenient wrapper-functions especially for polynomials or
             interactions. There is a generic plot()-method to plot the results
             using 'ggplot2'.
